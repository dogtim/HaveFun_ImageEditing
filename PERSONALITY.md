# Personality

# Abstract
To learn about the model of Heart, Will, or Head. Please read this article about personality types: [The Type of Team Diversity You’re Probably Not Paying Attention To](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uIz1D72DcthD8SNAEE_Lzw23CfpSUI1zL1SdMFzu9jw/edit)

# Takeaway: Breakthrough

The model, three "types" of people and how they see the world around them
 - Heart
 - Will
 - Head

I like this sentence, it is really a strong motivation to push people move on by themself.
> Because people want to grow. They want to develop and have a positive, meaningful impact on the organization

1. “why” behind the change for the ‘Head’ types
2. the step-by-step methodology for the ‘Will’ types
3. the impact on people for the ‘Heart’ types

The Positive & Negtive in one thing is same concept as **Tai Chi**

Come to my mind is that maybe we could discuss the "Heart/Will/Head" and ["D.I.S.C"](https://www.discprofile.com/what-is-disc) personalities together.

> Put people in situations that require them to stretch into areas in which they're not necessarily strong.

The comfort zone is the same way.

> Equipped with that insight, managers can move away from a one-size-fits-all messaging to accelerate each person’s contribution to the team.

Different type of people need different facilitated way and specific guidance

> The key is simply to avoid falling into the trap of hiring only people who think like you do
> We’re all naturally biased toward our own types

The key point of Hiring Perspective, and this is a [psychological behavior](https://www.psypost.org/2017/03/us-tend-attracted-people-similar-48596), we will be attracted to the same type as us.


## Issue
1. A invalid of link as "www.altschool.com 拒絕連線。"

## Question
1. Which type (Heart, Will, or Head) best describes yourself?  Why?
2. Describe a previous work situation when you or your group has had a conflict due to different types of people (Heart, Will, or Head), and explain how you handled it.

## TOTO
1. Make the 2-Dimension Matrix for "Heart/Will/Head" and ["D.I.S.C"], analyze the relationship between them.
